I have always been interested in Technology. From an early age, I would tinker with computers and software, building websites for family and friends since I was thirteen. As I became interested in games I learnt about the Java programming language which allowed me to create mods and add-ons. This fuelled my interest in computers and programming and drove me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering.
Now, in the second year of my degree, I am more passionate about my work than ever and I am now working on projects outside of my university work including a map based app for Android and iOS. Google has always been a company I have admired as it has grown from a simple search engine to a company that is truly making strides of innovation in almost every field imaginable. One of the main draws for me is the immense impact an employee at Google has on the rest of the world, improving the lives of millions of users around the world. In addition, I believe I work best in an environment where I am constantly challenged and required to develop innovative solutions to solve problems which is something that is common place at Google.Finally, I believe I would be a great fit at Google because I share its core principles particularly, the ability to ‘make money without doing evil’ and always striving to learn more believing ‘there’s always more information out there’.
